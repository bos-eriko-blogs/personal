description: Stressed out again

We're back here again. Super stressed out. I thought when I quit my job it'll be a nice change but another new problem popped up. I hate it. I don't like this. Why does she always do this? What's so fun about pushing me away and then when I get pushed she'll act all sad and lonely. What does she expect from me? Is doing this fun for her? I just don't get it.
