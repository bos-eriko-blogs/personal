If you've used GatsbyJS before for blogging you'll notice that to make new blogs you need to add a new folder on content/blog. You can name the new folder anything you like but I guess with that I will have problems in the future if I have conflicting names. So now what I did is I added the date and a counter on the folder name so I don't get that problem in the future. I little extra effort on naming the folders (which in turn becomes the URL after gatsby build) but I guess that's necessary.
