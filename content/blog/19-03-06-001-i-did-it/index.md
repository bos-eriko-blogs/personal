description: I've finally resigned!
---

After a few months of getting ready I finally did it. I've finally resigned from my work! Don't get me wrong, I like my work but the problem is, I want to do some other stuff. I want to take risks while I'm still young. This is why I decided to resign. I'm very thankful to the company for taking me in even though I was lacking the necessary skills when I first joined them. With that, I will forever be thankful.
