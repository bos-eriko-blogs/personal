What is up, random citizen? How are you? For me, I am good! I just watched Avengers: Endgame yesterday and it was nice. I have to say that it wasn't as good as I was expecting but it was really good. I was just expecting more. I also recently deactivated my Facebook account since I really don't use it that much anymore. I only go to my Facebook to see the pages I manage which I now moved on to an anonymouse Facebook account. Anyway, not much to say really.
